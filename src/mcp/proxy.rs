// MCP Proxy Service  (--mode client / --mode auto with serve detected)
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/// Transparent stdio↔HTTP proxy with automatic reconnect.
///
/// When `codesearch mcp --mode client` is started by Claude Desktop:
/// - Claude Desktop sends MCP requests over stdio
/// - `McpProxyService` forwards every request to the running `codesearch serve` hub via HTTP
/// - Responses flow back unchanged
///
/// This is the correct architecture for Claude Desktop: it has no repo context of its own
/// and therefore cannot use `--mode local`. With `--mode client` it always connects to
/// the serve hub, gaining access to all registered repos.
///
/// Only tool operations (`list_tools`, `call_tool`) are forwarded. Prompts, resources,
/// and completion are not proxied — the serve hub does not expose them.
///
/// ## Reconnect
///
/// The peer is wrapped in `Arc<RwLock<Option<Peer>>>` so it can be hot-swapped when the
/// serve connection drops and reconnects. During reconnection, tool calls return a
/// descriptive "reconnecting" error so Claude Desktop can retry.
///
/// ## Idle disconnect / connect on demand
///
/// The peer is also `None` while the proxy is *deliberately* disconnected: after
/// `CODESEARCH_MCP_PROXY_IDLE_DISCONNECT_SECS` (default
/// `DEFAULT_MCP_PROXY_IDLE_DISCONNECT_SECS`, `0` disables) without a successful
/// forwarded request, the idle-checker in `run_mcp_client` closes the HTTP MCP
/// session so a scale-to-zero remote can suspend its replica. Every successful
/// `list_tools` / `call_tool` stamps `last_activity`, which resets that window.
///
/// Because a closed session is indistinguishable from a dead one at the peer
/// slot, `call_tool` / `list_tools` signal `connect_request_tx` on their first
/// attempt whenever the slot is `None`, asking the main loop to connect *now*
/// instead of waiting for the failure-path reconnect cadence. The existing
/// bounded retry-with-backoff remains the fallback if that connect does not land
/// within the retry budget.
