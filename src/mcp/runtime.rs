/// Run `codesearch mcp` as a transparent stdio↔HTTP proxy to `codesearch serve`.
///
/// Architecture:
///   Claude Desktop ──(stdio JSON-RPC)──▶ McpProxyService ──(HTTP Streamable)──▶ codesearch serve
///
/// Every MCP request from Claude Desktop is forwarded verbatim to the serve hub and the
/// response is returned unchanged. This allows Claude Desktop — which has no repo context
/// of its own — to reach all repos managed by `codesearch serve`.
///
/// ## Reconnect behaviour
///
/// When `codesearch serve` goes away (restart, crash, network blip), the proxy does NOT
/// exit. Instead it:
/// 1. Keeps the stdio connection to Claude Desktop alive
/// 2. Returns "reconnecting" errors for any incoming tool calls
/// 3. Retries the HTTP connection every 3 seconds for up to 5 minutes
/// 4. On success, hot-swaps the peer — tool calls resume immediately
/// 5. After 5 minutes of failure, exits cleanly (Claude Desktop detects the disconnect)
///
/// ## Idle disconnect behaviour
///
/// One HTTP MCP session held open for the lifetime of the proxy keeps a request
/// permanently registered at the remote's ingress, so a scale-to-zero host never
/// sees 0 concurrent requests and never suspends the replica. To avoid that, the
/// connection is only held while it is actually being used:
///
/// - An idle-checker ticks every `MCP_PROXY_IDLE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS`. Once no
///   request has been forwarded for `CODESEARCH_MCP_PROXY_IDLE_DISCONNECT_SECS`
///   (default `DEFAULT_MCP_PROXY_IDLE_DISCONNECT_SECS`; `0` disables and restores
///   the always-connected behaviour), it clears the peer and cancels the
///   `RunningService`, closing the transport.
/// - That is a *planned* close, not an outage: it does not open a failure window
///   and does not count against `reconnect::MAX_DURATION_SECS`. The monitor task's
///   resulting `disconnect_tx` signal is recognised (via `voluntary_disconnect`)
///   and does not trigger an eager reconnect — reconnecting immediately would
///   defeat the purpose.
/// - The next `list_tools` / `call_tool` finds an empty peer slot and signals
///   `connect_request_tx`, which reconnects on demand. Failure-path reconnects
///   are unaffected and still run on their own cadence.
